## Project Overview

This framework demonstrates UI test automation using Playwright with an emphasis on:
- Clean code organization
- Reusable page components (Page Object Model)
- Effective use of Playwright fixtures
- API and UI test integration
- CI/CD pipelines with CircleCI and on-demand testing
- Real-time notifications via Slack

This project is ideal for showcasing your test automation skills during technical interviews.

## Key Features

- **Page Object Model (POM):**  
  - Encapsulates page behaviors in classes within a dedicated `pages/` directory.
  - Utilizes base components like `BasePage.ts`, making it easier to extend and maintain.

- **Fixtures Approach:**  
  - Uses Playwright fixtures (`fixtures/page-fixtures.ts` and `fixtures/employee-fixtures.ts`) to create and reuse page objects, API helpers, and test data factories for complex tests.
  - Minimizes duplication and ensures proper test setup and teardown.

- **User-first locator strategy:**  
  - Enhanced our element selection approach by implementing user-first locators that are more resilient and maintainable. As demonstrated in `LoginPage.ts`, we've moved from XPath-based selectors to Playwright's recommended user-centric locators

- **Storage state feature:**  
  - Implemented Playwright's storage state feature to maintain authentication between test runs, improving efficiency and reducing test execution time: (`tests/login/logged.setup.ts` and `tests/home/dashboard-storage-example.spec.ts`)
  - 
   ```sh
     npm run test:storaged

- **CI/CD Integration with CircleCI:**  
  - Configuration files in the `.circleci/` directory define jobs for running tests and building the project.
  - Available jobs include running specific test sets on-demand (e.g., smoke, regression, health) via parameterized pipelines.

- **Slack Notifications:**  
  - Integrates with Slack to provide real-time notifications for test failures and build statuses.
  - Customizable messages include test details, build URLs, and on-call notifications.

- **Cross-browser Testing:**  
  - Supports running tests on multiple browsers such as Chromium (Desktop) and mobile views via Playwright's device emulation.

## Technology Stack 

- **Playwright & TypeScript:** For E2E test automation.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime.
- **CircleCI:** For Continuous Integration and automated testing.
- **Docker:** Containerizing tests and builds.
- **Slack:** Notifications for build and test statuses.
- **Prettier:** Ensures consistent code formatting.

## CI/CD Integration 

The project integrates seamlessly with CircleCI:
- **Jobs:**  
  - The main test job (`test`) is defined in `.circleci/config.yml` and uses a Playwright Docker image.  
  - A build job (`build-and-push`) builds the Docker image, pushes it, and sends notifications.

- **On-Demand Test Sets:**  
  - A parameterized pipeline (`scheduled-pipeline.yml`) allows running different test sets (such as smoke, regression, and health) on-demand with customizable parameters like test-set and base URL.

- **Artifacts & Reporting:**  
  - Test results and Playwright reports are stored as artifacts and can be reviewed after each run.

## Slack Integration

- **Real-Time Feedback:**  
  The configuration uses the `circleci/slack` orb to instantly notify the team on both test failures and successful builds.
- **Customizable Messages:**  
  Slack notifications include detailed build information, test sets executed, branch name, and quick links to build details and generated reports.

## Running the Project

### Local Execution

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**
   - Run all tests:
     ```sh
     npm run test
     ```
   - Run specific test sets:
     ```sh
     npm run test:smoke     # Run smoke tests only
     npm run test:regression # Run regression tests only
     npm run test:dashboard  # Run dashboard-related tests only
     npm run test:failset # Run this to check how failures are reported
     ```

3. **View Test Report:**
   ```sh
   npx playwright show-report
   ```

### Using Docker

- **Run via Docker Compose:**
  ```sh
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

## Best Practices

- **Modular Code:**  
  Use page objects and fixtures to keep tests clean and maintainable.
- **Reuse & Extend:**  
  Leverage shared helpers and components to avoid code duplication.
- **Descriptive Tests:**  
  Write tests that clearly communicate user intent and behavior.
- **Automate Everything:**  
  Integrate CI/CD pipelines and notifications to catch issues early and keep your team informed.
- **Consistent Formatting:**  
  Use Prettier for a consistent code style across the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository.**
2. **Set up Environment Variables:**  
   Create a copy of `config/env.config.ts` and update with your environment values (e.g., `BASE_URL`, `USER_EMAIL`, `USER_PASSWORD`, etc.).

    + default BASE_URL = 'https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com'
    + default USER_EMAIL = 'Admin'
    + default USER_PASSWORD = 'admin123'
    
3. **Install Dependencies:**  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run Tests Locally or via Docker.**
5. **Review CI/CD Logs:**  
   Check CircleCI dashboards and Slack notifications to monitor test results.
